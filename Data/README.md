## This directory looks at manipulating data for both theoretical Millisecond Pulsars (MSP) as well as observational ones

**ExistingPulsarData.py:**
- This script will be imported onto another script at a later time, but for now it plots all observed pulsars onto the galactic plane to help with a visual comparison of simulated
  pulsars with the observed ones.
 
 **Histograms.py**:
 - This is a small script that calculates the histogram of the velocities for the observed millisecond pulsars as per the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) as well as the distribution of the velocity function used in the report.
 
**NeutStarsTest.py**
- The script illustrates how to extract information on specific simulated milisecond pulsars calculated in particles_init.py
  
**PulsarsDATAATNF(2019-04-24).txt:**
 - This script includes the data for all observed milisecond Pulsars following Lorimer 2008's definition where period 1.5 < T < 30ms.
 - It only includes the distance
 
 **VELOCITIESPulsarsDataATNF(2019-04-24).txt:**
 - This script includes the data for all observed MSP with a defined velocity (PMRA, PMDEC and VTRANS) and could possibly be used to look at the origin of some pulsars.

**VelocityOnlyPulsars.txt**:
- This text file includes the velocities of the observed millisecond pulsars as per ATNF
