**\textbf{Description of Proposed Research:}**

Describe the proposed research as accurately as you can within the stated maximum
number of words and pages. The maximum is 1,200 words on no more than three pages.

**Knowledge Utilisation:**

Describe your projectâ€™s potential for knowledge utilisation in a maximum of 500 words on
no more than one page.

When filling out this section, consider the following questions:
Potential

- Which contribution can the research make to society and/or to other scientific
areas? Examples are economic, social-administrative, cultural, technological,
medical or democratic areas. 'Society' is used in the sense of the entire society
and therefore both the public and private sectors.


- Which other disciplines and which organisations can benefit from the research
results? This concerns users in the public and private sectors, including scientists
in other disciplines. NB: If the research makes no contribution to society and/or to
other scientific areas, you need to explain this and in that case you do not need to
answer the question below about the implementation.
Implementation


- What is the action plan to allow the outcomes of the research project (see above)
to benefit potential knowledge users?


- How are the potential knowledge users involved (or how will they be involved) in
the research project? You should consider whether the tasks are clearly divided in
advance, whether the parties concerned have been involved in articulating the
research question, how they could contribute to achieving the utilisation
objectives and how the ongoing involvement with users will be safeguarded.
Examples are user committees, matchmaking, consortia/networks, public-private
partnerships (PPP) and contract research.


- What will be (concrete) outcomes for society and for other scientific areas?
Outcomes may include commercial products, new ways of working, processes, protocols, prototypes, co-publications, artefacts, media appearances, teaching
methods, patents, licences, contracts, specific network meetings, medical
interventions and websites.


- How long will it be before possible knowledge utilisation can be expected? 

**Other**

- Indicate the number of words used for the following sections: 2a (2a1 and 2a2
combined; maximum of 1,200 words) and 2b (maximum of 500 words). Words in figures,
footnotes, figure captions, in-text references and tables should be included in the count.
