## This branch looks at manipulating both theoretical Millisecond Pulsars (MSP) as well as observational ones.

**ExistingPulsarData.py:**
- This script will be imported onto another script at a later time, but for now it plots all observed pulsars onto the galactic plane to help with a visual comparison of simulated
  pulsars with the observed ones.
  
 **MilkyWayIsoPotential.py**
 - This script simply plots the isopotential contours of our Milky Way model.
  
**PulsarsDATAATNF(2019-04-24).txt:**
 - This script includes the data for all observed milisecond Pulsars following Lorimer 2008's definition where period T < 30ms.
 - It only includes the distance
 
 **VELOCITIESPulsarsDataATNF(2019-04-24).txt:**
 - This script includes the data for all observed MSP with a defined velocity (PMRA, PMDEC and VTRANS) and could possibly be used to look at the origin of some pulsars.
