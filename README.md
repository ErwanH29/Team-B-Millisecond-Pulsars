## This folder is for the scripts the report and simulation are based off of.

This GitHub incorporates the code utilising AMUSE which analyses the possibility of millisecond pulsars shot out from the Large Magellanic Cloud being captured inside the Milky Way.

The Data directory shows the main references used in the project, observations of existing pulsars as well as small test scripts used to manipulate such data and the other repository is the code the research is based off of.

The project proposal gives a good introduction on the aims of our research and how we intend to achieve it and lies with the final report in the directory Documents.

For visualization of the code, these three GIF files illustrate the dynamics of the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud potentials in the Milky Way potential over a time of 270 million years, starting at present time, as calculated by our code. The imaged planes are (x,y), (x,z) and (y,z) respectively.
