The code contained in this repository simulates a system consisting of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, a globular cluster and the Milky Way.
The positions of the Large and Small Magellanic cloud are first calculated 1 Gyr back in time using current position and velocity coordinates.
Upon running, pulsars will be generated along the trajectory of the globular cluster, which in itself is moving inside the Large Magellanic Cloud potential, which in itself feels the Milky Way potential.
After running, data can be generated from the simulation.

For visualization of the code, these three GIF files illustrate the dynamics of the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud potentials in the Milky Way potential over a time of 270 million years, starting at present time, as calculated by our code. The imaged planes are (x,y), (x,z) and (y,z) respectively.
