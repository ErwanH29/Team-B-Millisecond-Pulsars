This GitHub incorporates the code utilising AMUSE which analyses the possibility of millisecond pulsars shot out from the Large Magellanic Cloud being captured inside the Milky Way.

The two main directories within the repository are ones containing the data, that is references, observations of existing pulsars and small test scripts used to manipulate such data and the other repository is the code the research is based off of.

The project proposal gives a good introduction on the aims of our research and how we intend to achieve it.
